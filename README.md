🌾 Crop Yield Estimation using Satellite NDVI (MODIS/Sentinel)
This project focuses on early crop yield prediction using satellite-derived NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from MODIS and Sentinel platforms. Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE) for data extraction and machine learning models like Multiple Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), this system provides a non-invasive, cost-effective solution to estimate yields before harvest.
